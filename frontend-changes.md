# Frontend Changes - Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to improve code consistency and maintainability across the RAG chatbot codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **Black 24.10.0**: Automatic code formatting tool for Python
- **Flake8 7.1.1**: Linting tool for style checking and error detection

Updated `pyproject.toml` with new dependencies and configuration.

### 2. Configuration Files

#### Black Configuration (in pyproject.toml)
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Proper exclusions for virtual environments and build directories

#### Flake8 Configuration (.flake8)
- Max line length: 88 characters (matches Black)
- Ignores Black-compatible rules (E203, W503, E501)
- Excludes virtual environments and build directories

### 3. Development Scripts Created

#### `scripts/format.py`
- Runs Black formatter on entire codebase
- Provides user-friendly output with status indicators
- Handles errors gracefully with clear error messages

#### `scripts/lint.py`
- Runs Flake8 linting checks on entire codebase
- Reports linting issues with clear messaging
- Exits with appropriate codes for CI/CD integration

#### `scripts/check.py`
- Comprehensive quality check script
- Runs both formatting checks and linting
- Provides summary of all check results
- Suggests remediation steps for failures

### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- Automatically formatted entire Python codebase using Black
- 13 files reformatted with consistent styling
- Improved code readability and consistency

### 5. Documentation Updates

#### Updated CLAUDE.md
Added new "Code Quality Tools" section with:
- Instructions for running formatting and linting
- Manual command reference for Black and Flake8
- Integration with existing development workflow

## Developer Workflow Integration

### Daily Development
1. **Format code**: `python scripts/format.py`
2. **Check quality**: `python scripts/check.py`

### Before Commits
Run `python scripts/check.py` to ensure code quality standards are met.

### CI/CD Ready
All scripts return proper exit codes for integration with automated testing pipelines.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Uniform code formatting across the entire codebase
2. **Quality**: Automated detection of style issues and potential bugs
3. **Productivity**: Developers don't need to manually format code
4. **Maintainability**: Easier code reviews with consistent styling
5. **Standards**: Established coding standards for the project

## Current Status
- ✅ All tools installed and configured
- ✅ Codebase formatted with Black
- ✅ Development scripts created and tested
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⚠️  Some linting issues remain (imports, unused variables) - these can be addressed in future iterations

The code quality foundation is now in place and ready for regular use in the development workflow.
