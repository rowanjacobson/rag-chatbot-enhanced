# Frontend Changes Made

## Overview
No direct frontend changes were made as part of this testing framework enhancement. This was a backend testing infrastructure improvement that focuses on API endpoint testing and testing framework configuration.

## Backend Testing Infrastructure Enhancements

### 1. pytest Configuration Added to pyproject.toml
- Added pytest, pytest-asyncio, and httpx as dependencies
- Configured pytest.ini_options with proper test paths and settings
- Added test markers for unit, integration, and API tests
- Enabled asyncio mode for testing async endpoints

### 2. Test Fixtures Created in conftest.py
- **Mock RAG System**: Complete mock of the RAG system for isolated testing
- **Mock Session Manager**: Session management mocking for API tests
- **Test FastAPI App**: Standalone test application to avoid static file import issues
- **Test Client**: FastAPI test client for API endpoint testing
- **Sample Data Fixtures**: Sample requests, responses, and test data
- **Temporary Directory**: For testing document processing functionality

### 3. API Endpoint Tests in test_api_endpoints.py
- **Query Endpoint Tests**: `/api/query` endpoint with various scenarios
  - Valid queries with and without session IDs
  - Empty and very long queries
  - Invalid JSON and missing fields
  - Exception handling and error responses
  - Response structure validation
- **Courses Endpoint Tests**: `/api/courses` endpoint testing
  - Successful course statistics retrieval
  - Empty results handling
  - Exception scenarios
  - Response structure validation
- **Root Endpoint Test**: Health check endpoint testing
- **CORS and Middleware Tests**: Cross-origin and middleware functionality
- **Request Validation Tests**: Input validation and error handling
- **Sequential Request Tests**: Multiple request handling and session management

## Testing Benefits for Frontend Development

While no frontend code was changed, these testing enhancements provide significant benefits for frontend development:

1. **API Contract Validation**: Tests ensure API endpoints behave consistently, giving frontend developers confidence in the API contract.

2. **Error Handling Verification**: Tests validate that proper HTTP status codes and error messages are returned, helping frontend error handling logic.

3. **Response Structure Assurance**: Tests verify that API responses match expected schemas, preventing frontend integration issues.

4. **Session Management Validation**: Tests ensure session-based conversation flow works correctly for the chat interface.

5. **CORS Configuration Testing**: Validates that the frontend can successfully make cross-origin requests to the API.

## Running the Enhanced Test Suite

```bash
# Run only API tests
uv run pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v

# Run all tests with markers
uv run pytest tests/ -m "api" -v

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

The enhanced testing framework provides robust validation of the RAG system's API layer, ensuring reliable integration between the frontend chat interface and the backend AI processing system.
